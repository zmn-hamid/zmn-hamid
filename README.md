### who_am_i

Hi, I'm Hamidreza Zamanian (you can call me Hamid). I was born in 2001.  
One might know me by many things:
- <b>Python programmer of 5 years</b> (at the time of writing: 2025) - 
    primarily working with third-party APIs and automation tools
- <b>Telegram bot programmer</b> - solo developer behind Telegram's best unknown message bot: @ChevaletBot
- <b>Game Developer</b> - spoiler: This is actually what I'm doing full time right now :)
- <b>Graphic Designer & Digital Artist</b> - you can check my 3D and 2D arts 
    in my linktree page bellow (in artstation)
- Animal enthusiast and so on :D

### my_career_personality

I love to learn. I've dipped my toe into any aspect of art I could
and tried staying focused in my programming path (I failed, I'm a game developer now :D).
From collage art to Blender, to developing an addon for Aseprite and to game development.
This is essentially the reason why I've chosen to become a game developer.

This trait makes me a fast learner and fast forgetter. Meaning I learn the things
I want/need to, fast enough, but forget my physical needs fast enough as well :)
Quick note: I've managed to handle it. Said that for the sake of impact :D

Oh did I mention? I'm self-taught. I've learned everything I know from the internet.
None of my majors did anything for me (talking about computer science and graphic design (current one))
